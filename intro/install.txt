Using Git with Command Line

To start using Git, we are first going to open up our Command shell.

For Windows, you can use Git bash, which comes included in Git for Windows. For Mac and Linux you can use the built-in terminal.

The first thing we need to do, is to check if Git is properly installed:

For example.... Using the command below:

          git --version


If Git is installed, it should show something like .........git version X.Y

Configure Git

Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:    

Using the command below:

          git config --global user.name "malcolms-anatomy"
          git config --global user.email "malcolmihere@outlook.com"

          NOTE: Modify the username and email to yours on github! 

Note: Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.

If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global
