Git Adding New Files

You just created your first local Git repo. But it is empty.

So let's add some files, or create a new file using your favourite text editor. Then save or move it to the folder you just created.

I used the vim editor to create a html file "index.html". (You can install the vim editor if you don't have it)

After creating your file, use the ls command to list out the file you've just created.

Then we check the Git status and see if it is a part of our repo using the command below:

       git status.

Now Git is aware of the file, but has not added it to our repository!

Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:

    Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
    Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository

 When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.
