Initialize Git

Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder:
Use the command below:

    git init

You just created your first Git Repository!

Note: Git now knows that it should watch the folder you initiated it on.

Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.
